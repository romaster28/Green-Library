## Introduction

Green Library - it's independent game packages library (mostly for Unity). The main feature of all packages is model based architecture so you can easy customize them for any of your task. It contains simulations, editor tools, base models and many others funcional things to help create your powerfull games. With Green Library you don't need to keep in your assets folder heap of conflicting stuff. You no longer need to keep in your head or in a folder a bunch of packages that need to be installed in a new project, just add one Green Library Package and get base of any game creation path helpers. Just keep Green Library and forget about garbage package problem.
